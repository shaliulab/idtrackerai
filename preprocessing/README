 - does nothing

Blob detection:
  preprocessing:
    read idTrackerDeepGUI.py from line 31 to 98
    ---it should not be changed in order to affect the computation of the heads

  segmentation.py
    given some parameters (threshold, minimal area of the blob, et cetera) gives
    blobs as output

 fragmentation.py
    looks at blob overlapping in order to identify individual non-crossing fragments of the video

 get_portraits.py
    takes a miniframe (bounding box of a blob - fish), outputs the head in a square 32x32
    the function getPortrait is the responsible for the generation of the final square image of the head of the fish

to visualise the frame, change preprocessing params on the fly and see the result of the reaping (head-cut and orientation)
you can use the function SegmentationPreview in GUI_utils line 206
