Validation GUI
==============

In this version, the GUI to validate and correct the trajectories is separated
from the GUI used to track the videos. The new validatoin GUI is a sumbodule of
bigger project called `Python video annotator <https://pythonvideoannotator.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html>`_
developed by the `Scientific Software Platform <http://neuro.fchampalimaud.org/en/research/platforms/staff/Scientific%20Software/>`_
at the Champalimaud Foundation.

However, it is very easy to access it and it comes install it by default when
you install idtracker.ai with GUI support.

Check the `idtrackerai validator GUI documentation <https://pythonvideoannotator.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/idtrackerai.html>`_ to learn how to launch it,
correct identities and save new trajectories files.
